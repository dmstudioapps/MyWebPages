<h1>Privacy Policy for To-Do List - Task Tracker</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 26 December 2025</p>

<p>
To-Do List - Task Tracker (“the App”) is developed by Data & Mind Studio. Your privacy is important to us.
This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the App.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
The App does not directly collect, store, or transmit personal information.
All tasks, reminders, and settings are stored locally on your device.
</p>

<h2>2. Advertisements</h2>
<p>
The App displays bottom banner advertisements using third-party advertising services
(such as Google AdMob).
</p>
<p>
These services may automatically collect limited information such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advertising ID</li>
  <li>Device type and operating system</li>
  <li>Approximate (non-precise) location</li>
</ul>
<p>
This data is collected by the ad provider, not by us, and is governed by their
respective privacy policies.
</p>

<h2>3. In-App Purchases (Remove Ads)</h2>
<p>
The App offers a one-time, non-consumable in-app purchase to remove advertisements.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Payments are processed securely by Google Play</li>
  <li>We do not collect or store payment information</li>
  <li>Purchase status is stored locally on your device</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Local Device Storage</h2>
<p>
All user-created data remains on your device only.
Uninstalling the App will permanently delete this data.
</p>

<h2>5. Notifications</h2>
<p>
The App uses device-based local notifications to remind you of tasks.
No notification data is transmitted externally.
</p>

<h2>6. No Accounts or Login</h2>
<p>
The App does not require user registration, login, or cloud synchronization.
</p>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
</p>

<h2>8. Security</h2>
<p>
We rely on your device’s operating system for data protection.
You are responsible for securing your device and backups.
</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
Any changes will be reflected in the App or its Play Store listing.
