<h1>Privacy Policy – Daily Reflection Journal</h1>
<p class="meta"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> {{2025-12-29}}</p>

<p>
  Daily Reflection Journal (“the App”) is developed and provided by
  <strong>Data &amp; Mind Studio</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”). This Privacy Policy explains
  how we handle your information when you use the App.
</p>
<p>
  By installing or using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
  If you do not agree, please do not use the App.
</p>

<h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>

<h3>1.1 Data You Enter</h3>
<p>
  The App allows you to create journal entries, reflections, reminders, and preferences
  (“User Content”).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>All User Content is stored locally on your device.</strong> We do not collect,
  store, transmit, or view your journal entries or personal reflections.
</p>

<h3>1.2 No Personal Information Collected</h3>
<p>We do not require or collect the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Email address</li>
  <li>Phone number</li>
  <li>Precise location</li>
  <li>Contacts</li>
  <li>Photos/media/files (outside of the app’s own storage area)</li>
  <li>Device identifiers</li>
  <li>Analytics data (unless explicitly introduced in a future version)</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.3 Third-party services</h3>
<p>The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google Play Services</li>
        <li>Google Analytics for Firebase (Firebase Analytics)</li>
    </ul>
<h2>2. Permissions We Use</h2>
<p>
  The App may request certain permissions in order to function properly. These may include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Notifications</strong> – to send reminders and reflective prompts.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Storage / File Access</strong> – to save journal data, backups, or export files
    locally on your device (if such features are enabled).
  </li>
  <li><strong>Alarms (Android)</strong> – to schedule time-based reminders.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Granting these permissions is optional, but some features may not work correctly if they are
  denied.
</p>

<h2>3. How Your Data Is Stored</h2>
<p>
  All journal entries, reminders, and user settings are stored
  <strong>only on your device</strong>, using local storage or a local database, depending on
  the version of the App.
</p>
<p>
  We do not have access to your data. We do not transfer your data to any server or third-party
  service in the current version of the App.
</p>
<p>
  If you uninstall the App, reset your device, or clear the App’s data, your journal entries and
  settings may be permanently deleted unless you have created a backup.
</p>

<h2>4. Cloud Sync or Backups (Future Features)</h2>
<p>
  If we introduce optional features such as cloud sync, online backups, or account-based
  services in the future:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>We will clearly inform you within the App.</li>
  <li>We will request your explicit consent before uploading any data.</li>
  <li>This Privacy Policy will be updated to describe how that data is handled.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<h3>5.1 Analytics (Firebase)</h3>
<p>
    We use Google Analytics for Firebase to help us understand how users interact with Daily Reflection Journal.
    This allows us to improve the user experience and app performance.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Data Collected:</b> Firebase Analytics automatically collects certain information, including but not limited to:
      <ol>
          <li><b>Device Identifiers:</b> (e.g., Android Advertising ID, Firebase Installation ID).</li>
          <li><b>App Activity:</b> (e.g., Session duration, screens visited, button clicks).</li>
          <li><b>Device Info:</b> (e.g., Device model, OS version, region/language settings).</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> This data is used solely for analyzing app usage, identifying crashes, and improving app functionality.
      We do not use this data to identify individual users personally.</li>
  <li><b>Third-Party Disclosure:</b> This data is shared with Google to provide the analytics service.
      You can read more about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps
      at: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites.</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>5.2 Your Choices & Opt-Out</h3>
<p>You can opt out of certain Firebase features through your mobile device settings, such as your device advertising settings.</p>

<h3>5.3 Retention and Security</h3>
<p>Data collected via Firebase is stored on Google’s secure servers.
    We retain this data for as long as necessary to provide the analytics services described above,
    typically up to 14 months for user-level data.</p>
<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>
  We design the App to keep your data on your device, which reduces many common privacy risks.
  However, no method of storage is completely secure.
</p>
<p>Potential risks include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Loss or theft of your device.</li>
  <li>Hardware failure or operating system errors.</li>
  <li>Other apps on your device with elevated permissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We recommend that you secure your device with a strong password or biometric lock and,
  where possible, create backups of important data.
</p>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
  The App is intended for users aged <strong>13 and older</strong>. We do not knowingly
  collect personal information from children. If you believe that a child has provided personal
  information to us through any related channel, please contact us so we can take appropriate
  action.
</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
  We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the
  “Last Updated” date at the top of this page.
</p>
<p>
  Significant changes may also be communicated within the App or in release notes. Your
  continued use of the App after any changes means you accept the updated Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
<p>
  Because we do not collect or store your personal data on our servers, traditional data
  access, correction, or deletion requests are handled entirely on your device.
</p>
<p>You can delete your data by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using any in-app “Reset” or “Clear Data” function, if available; or</li>
  <li>Uninstalling the App from your device.</li>
</ul>
