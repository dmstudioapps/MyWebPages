<h1>Privacy Policy – Daily Reflection Journal</h1>
<p class="meta"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> {{2025-12-14}}</p>

<p>
  Daily Reflection Journal (“the App”) is developed and provided by
  <strong>Data &amp; Mind Studio</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”). This Privacy Policy explains
  how we handle your information when you use the App.
</p>
<p>
  By installing or using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
  If you do not agree, please do not use the App.
</p>

<h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>

<h3>1.1 Data You Enter</h3>
<p>
  The App allows you to create journal entries, reflections, reminders, and preferences
  (“User Content”).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>All User Content is stored locally on your device.</strong> We do not collect,
  store, transmit, or view your journal entries or personal reflections.
</p>

<h3>1.2 No Personal Information Collected</h3>
<p>We do not require or collect the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Email address</li>
  <li>Phone number</li>
  <li>Precise location</li>
  <li>Contacts</li>
  <li>Photos/media/files (outside of the app’s own storage area)</li>
  <li>Device identifiers</li>
  <li>Analytics data (unless explicitly introduced in a future version)</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Permissions We Use</h2>
<p>
  The App may request certain permissions in order to function properly. These may include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Notifications</strong> – to send reminders and reflective prompts.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Storage / File Access</strong> – to save journal data, backups, or export files
    locally on your device (if such features are enabled).
  </li>
  <li><strong>Alarms (Android)</strong> – to schedule time-based reminders.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Granting these permissions is optional, but some features may not work correctly if they are
  denied.
</p>

<h2>3. How Your Data Is Stored</h2>
<p>
  All journal entries, reminders, and user settings are stored
  <strong>only on your device</strong>, using local storage or a local database, depending on
  the version of the App.
</p>
<p>
  We do not have access to your data. We do not transfer your data to any server or third-party
  service in the current version of the App.
</p>
<p>
  If you uninstall the App, reset your device, or clear the App’s data, your journal entries and
  settings may be permanently deleted unless you have created a backup.
</p>

<h2>4. Cloud Sync or Backups (Future Features)</h2>
<p>
  If we introduce optional features such as cloud sync, online backups, or account-based
  services in the future:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>We will clearly inform you within the App.</li>
  <li>We will request your explicit consent before uploading any data.</li>
  <li>This Privacy Policy will be updated to describe how that data is handled.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
  The current version of the App does <strong>not</strong> use third-party analytics,
  advertising networks, or external databases. This means:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>No third-party tracking SDKs are integrated.</li>
  <li>No advertising networks are used within the App.</li>
  <li>Your journal data is not shared with any third-party service.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If we decide to introduce optional analytics (for example, to understand app usage in a
  privacy-friendly way), we will:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Update this Privacy Policy before such changes go live.</li>
  <li>Request your consent where required by law.</li>
  <li>Provide options to opt out, where applicable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>
  We design the App to keep your data on your device, which reduces many common privacy risks.
  However, no method of storage is completely secure.
</p>
<p>Potential risks include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Loss or theft of your device.</li>
  <li>Hardware failure or operating system errors.</li>
  <li>Other apps on your device with elevated permissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We recommend that you secure your device with a strong password or biometric lock and,
  where possible, create backups of important data.
</p>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
  The App is intended for users aged <strong>13 and older</strong>. We do not knowingly
  collect personal information from children. If you believe that a child has provided personal
  information to us through any related channel, please contact us so we can take appropriate
  action.
</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
  We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the
  “Last Updated” date at the top of this page.
</p>
<p>
  Significant changes may also be communicated within the App or in release notes. Your
  continued use of the App after any changes means you accept the updated Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
<p>
  Because we do not collect or store your personal data on our servers, traditional data
  access, correction, or deletion requests are handled entirely on your device.
</p>
<p>You can delete your data by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using any in-app “Reset” or “Clear Data” function, if available; or</li>
  <li>Uninstalling the App from your device.</li>
</ul>
